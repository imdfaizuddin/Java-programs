### **Understanding 1â€™s and 2â€™s Complement with Explanation**  

#### **1â€™s Complement**  
1â€™s complement is a way of representing the negative of a number in binary by flipping all the bits (0 â†’ 1, 1 â†’ 0).  

ðŸ”¹ **Why is it used?**  
It was an early method to represent negative numbers in binary. However, it has a drawback: there are two representations of zero (`0000` and `1111` in 4-bit representation). This leads to computational issues, so 2â€™s complement is preferred.  

âœ… **Example (4-bit representation of +5 and -5 using 1â€™s complement)**  
- **+5** â†’ `0101`  
- **-5** (1â€™s complement) â†’ `1010` (flipping all bits)  

ðŸ›‘ **Problem:** There are two zeroes (`0000` and `1111`), making arithmetic operations difficult.

#### **2â€™s Complement**  
2â€™s complement solves the issue of two zeroes by ensuring only one representation of zero. It is found by taking the 1â€™s complement and adding 1.  

ðŸ”¹ **Why is it used?**  
- It simplifies binary subtraction (addition and subtraction use the same hardware).  
- It avoids having two zero representations.  

âœ… **Example (4-bit representation of +5 and -5 using 2â€™s complement)**  
1. **+5** â†’ `0101`  
2. **Find 1â€™s complement of 5** â†’ `1010`  
3. **Add 1** â†’  
   ```
   1010
 + 0001
  ------
   1011
   ```
4. **-5 (2â€™s complement)** â†’ `1011`

### **How to Identify Positive and Negative Numbers in 2â€™s Complement?**  
- If **MSB (Most Significant Bit) is 0**, the number is **positive**.  
- If **MSB is 1**, the number is **negative** (stored in 2â€™s complement form).  

âœ… **Examples:**  
- `0110` (MSB = 0) â†’ **Positive (6)**  
- `1011` (MSB = 1) â†’ **Negative (-5 using 2â€™s complement)**

### **Converting 2â€™s Complement Back to Decimal**
To find the decimal value of a **negative** binary number in 2â€™s complement:  
1. Check if MSB is **1** (indicating a negative number).  
2. Take the **2â€™s complement** (flip bits and add 1).  
3. Convert to decimal and add a negative sign.  

âœ… **Example (Finding Decimal of `1011` in 4-bit system)**  
1. `1011` (MSB = 1, so itâ€™s negative).  
2. Take **1â€™s complement**: `0100`  
3. Add 1: `0101` â†’ **5**  
4. Add negative sign â†’ **-5**

### **Summary**
| Binary Representation | 1â€™s Complement | 2â€™s Complement |
|----------------------|---------------|---------------|
| `0101` (+5)        | `1010`         | `1011` (-5)  |
| `0110` (+6)        | `1001`         | `1010` (-6)  |

- **1â€™s complement:** Flip all bits.  
- **2â€™s complement:** Flip all bits and add 1.  
- **Negative numbers in 2â€™s complement always start with 1**.
