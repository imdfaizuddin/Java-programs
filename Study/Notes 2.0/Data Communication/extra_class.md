### **Data Link Layer (DLL)**
The **Data Link Layer** is the second layer of the **OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model**. It is responsible for **node-to-node communication** and provides reliable data transfer over the physical layer.

### **Functions of the Data Link Layer**
1. **Framing**  
   - The DLL breaks the stream of bits received from the network layer into **frames** (structured packets of data).  
   - It adds headers and trailers to define the beginning and end of each frame.

2. **Flow Control**  
   - Ensures that the sender does not overwhelm the receiver by sending data at a rate higher than the receiver can process.  
   - Common techniques: **Stop-and-Wait Protocol**, **Sliding Window Protocol**.

3. **Error Handling**  
   - Detects and corrects errors that may occur during transmission.  
   - Uses error detection methods like **Parity Check, CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check), Checksum**.  
   - Some protocols also support **error correction**.

4. **Physical Addressing (MAC Addressing)**  
   - Each device on a network has a **MAC (Media Access Control) address**, a **48-bit hexadecimal number** (e.g., **00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E**).  
   - The MAC address uniquely identifies devices within a network.

## **Error Detection and Error Correction**
Errors occur when the received data differs from the sent data. These errors can be classified into:

### **Types of Errors**
1. **Single Bit Error**  
   - Only **one** bit is altered (0 â†’ 1 or 1 â†’ 0).  
   - Example:  
     - **Sent:** `10101010`  
     - **Received:** `10101000` (only one bit flipped)

2. **Multi-bit Error**  
   - **More than one** bit is altered in a single transmission.  
   - Example:  
     - **Sent:** `10101010`  
     - **Received:** `10000010` (multiple bits flipped)

3. **Burst Error**  
   - A **sequence** of bits (more than one) is altered due to noise or interference.  
   - Example (burst of 4 bits changed):  
     - **Sent:** `101010101011`  
     - **Received:** `101000001011`

## **Parity Check (Error Detection)**
Parity checking is a simple method for detecting errors in transmitted data.

### **Types of Parity Check**
1. **Even Parity**  
   - The number of **1s in the data** should be **even** (including the parity bit).  
   - If the count of 1s is odd, an extra `1` is added to make it even.  
   - Example:  
     - **Data:** `1010001` (3 ones â†’ odd)  
     - **Even Parity Bit:** `1`  
     - **Transmitted Data:** `10100011`

2. **Odd Parity**  
   - The number of **1s in the data** should be **odd** (including the parity bit).  
   - If the count of 1s is even, an extra `1` is added to make it odd.  
   - Example:  
     - **Data:** `1010001` (3 ones â†’ odd)  
     - **Odd Parity Bit:** `0`  
     - **Transmitted Data:** `10100010`

### **Parity Check Limitations**
- It **only detects errors**, but **cannot correct them**.  
- If an **even number of bits** change, the error may go undetected.  
- Not suitable for high-noise environments.
