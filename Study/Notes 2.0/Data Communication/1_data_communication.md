# **Data Communication and Networking**  

### **Communication**  
- The exchange of information between two or more entities using a medium.  

### **Network**  
- A collection of interconnected nodes (computers, devices, or servers) that share and exchange data.

## **Types of Signals**  
1. **Analog Signal** â€“ Continuous wave signals that vary over time (e.g., sound waves, AM/FM radio signals).  
2. **Digital Signal** â€“ Discrete signals represented by binary values (0s and 1s), used in computers and modern communication systems.  

---

## **Modem (Modulator-Demodulator)**  
A device that enables communication between digital and analog systems by converting signals.  

### **Signal Conversion:**  
- **Modulation:** Converting a digital signal into an analog signal (used for transmission over analog mediums like telephone lines).  
- **Demodulation:** Converting an analog signal back into a digital signal (used for decoding at the receiverâ€™s end).

## **Signal Degradation Factors**  

### **1. Attenuation (Signal Loss)**  
- **Definition:** A decrease in signal strength as it propagates through a medium.  
- **Causes:** Resistance in cables, absorption in the medium, longer distances.  
- **Solutions:** Use **amplifiers (analog signals)** or **repeaters (digital signals)** to boost signal strength.  

### **2. Dispersion (Signal Spread and Overlapping)**  
- **Definition:** As a signal travels through a medium, it tends to spread and overlap with adjacent signals.  
- **Impact:** Leads to signal distortion and data corruption, particularly in high-speed networks.  
- **Types:**  
  - **Modal Dispersion** â€“ Occurs in multimode optical fibers due to different light paths.  
  - **Chromatic Dispersion** â€“ Caused by different wavelengths of light traveling at different speeds in fiber optics.  
  - **Inter-Symbol Interference (ISI)** â€“ Digital signals interfere with each other due to dispersion.  
- **Solution:** Use **single-mode optical fiber** and **monochromatic light sources (lasers).**  

### **3. Noise (Unwanted Disturbances in Signals)**  
- **Definition:** Random disturbances or fluctuations in an analog or digital signal that distort actual information.  
- **Types of Noise:**  
  - **Thermal Noise** â€“ Caused by random motion of electrons in electronic circuits.  
  - **Intermodulation Noise** â€“ Occurs when different frequencies mix and interfere.  
  - **Crosstalk** â€“ When signals from adjacent channels interfere with each other.  
  - **Impulse Noise** â€“ Sudden spikes caused by power surges, lightning, or switching circuits.  
- **Solutions:** Use **shielded cables, error correction techniques, and noise reduction filters.**

## **Transmission Mediums**  

### **1. Wired Media**  
- **Twisted Pair Cable** â€“ Two copper wires twisted together, used in telephone lines and LANs.  
- **Coaxial Cable** â€“ Single copper conductor with shielding, used in cable TV and broadband.  
- **Optical Fiber** â€“ Uses light signals for high-speed and long-distance transmission with minimal interference.  

### **2. Wireless Media**  
- **Infrared** â€“ Short-range communication (e.g., remote controls).  
- **Radio Waves** â€“ Used in Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and AM/FM radio.  
- **Microwave** â€“ Used for long-distance communication, satellite links.  
- **Satellite Communication** â€“ Global communication using satellites for GPS, broadcasting, and internet access.

## **Switching in Networking**  

### **Definition:**  
- **Switching is a mechanism that directs data from the source to the destination across a network, even if they are not directly connected.**  
- **It helps in optimizing network efficiency by choosing the best path for data transmission.**  

### **Types of Switching**  

#### **1. Circuit Switching**  
- A dedicated communication path is established between the sender and receiver for the entire duration of the conversation.  
- **Example:** Traditional telephone systems.  
- **Advantages:**  
  - Provides a constant and reliable connection.  
  - Low latency since the path remains reserved.  
- **Disadvantages:**  
  - Wastes resources when no data is being transmitted.  
  - Not suitable for bursty data traffic like the internet.  

#### **2. Packet Switching**  
- Data is broken into **packets**,each packet contain a destination address and each taking the best available route independently to reach the destination.  
- **Example:** The Internet, email, VoIP.  
- **Advantages:**  
  - Efficient use of network resources.  
  - No dedicated path needed, allowing multiple users to share the network.  
  - Reliable and faster for data transmission.  
- **Disadvantages:**  
  - Packets may take different paths and arrive out of order, requiring reassembly.  
  - More complex protocols are needed to handle lost or delayed packets.  

#### **3. Message Switching**  
- The entire message is sent to intermediate nodes before reaching the final destination, where it is **stored and forwarded**.  
- **Example:** Email, SMS messaging.  
- **Advantages:**  
  - Does not require a dedicated circuit.  
  - Efficient for storing and forwarding large messages.  
- **Disadvantages:**  
  - Higher delays as messages are stored before being forwarded.  
  - Requires large storage capacity at intermediate nodes.

### **Comparison of Switching Techniques**  

| Switching Type | Connection Type | Suitable for | Speed | Efficiency |
|---------------|----------------|--------------|--------|-----------|
| Circuit Switching | Dedicated path | Voice calls, real-time communication | High | Low (wastes bandwidth when idle) |
| Packet Switching | No fixed path | Internet, data transfer | High | High |
| Message Switching | Store-and-forward | Email, SMS | Low | Moderate |
