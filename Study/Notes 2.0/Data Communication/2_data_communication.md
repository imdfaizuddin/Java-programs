### **4. Repeater**  
âœ… **Definition:** A device that amplifies and regenerates a weak signal to extend the network range.  
âœ… **Function:**  
   - Used in long-distance communication to maintain signal strength.  
   - Operates at the **Physical Layer (Layer 1)**.  
âœ… **Example:** Signal boosters for Wi-Fi networks.  
âœ… **Exam Tip:** Repeaters **do not filter traffic**; they just amplify the signal.  

---

### **5. Modem (Modulator-Demodulator)**  
âœ… **Definition:** A device that converts digital signals into analog (modulation) and vice versa (demodulation) for communication over telephone lines.  
âœ… **Function:**  
   - Enables internet access via telephone lines, DSL, or fiber optics.  
âœ… **Types:**  
   - **DSL Modem** â€“ Used for broadband internet over telephone lines.  
   - **Cable Modem** â€“ Used for broadband internet via coaxial cables.  
âœ… **Exam Tip:** **A modem is necessary for internet access over traditional phone lines.**

### **6. Switch**  
âœ… **Definition:** A device that connects multiple devices in a LAN and forwards data based on MAC addresses.  
âœ… **Function:**  
   - Operates at the **Data Link Layer (Layer 2)**.  
   - Provides efficient communication by sending data only to the intended recipient.  
âœ… **Types:**  
   - **Unmanaged Switch** â€“ Basic, plug-and-play switches.  
   - **Managed Switch** â€“ Allows network configuration and monitoring.  
âœ… **Exam Tip:** A **switch is more efficient than a hub** because it sends data only to the intended device.  

---

### **7. Hub**  
âœ… **Definition:** A basic networking device that broadcasts data to all connected devices.  
âœ… **Function:**  
   - Operates at the **Physical Layer (Layer 1)**.  
   - Does **not filter** traffic, leading to network congestion.  
âœ… **Types:**  
   - **Active Hub** â€“ Has its own power supply and amplifies signals.  
   - **Passive Hub** â€“ Does not amplify signals, only distributes them.  
âœ… **Exam Tip:** A **hub is less efficient than a switch** because it broadcasts data to all devices, increasing network traffic.  

---

### **8. Router**  
âœ… **Definition:** A device that connects different networks and forwards data based on IP addresses.  
âœ… **Function:**  
   - Operates at the **Network Layer (Layer 3)**.  
   - Determines the best path for data transmission using routing algorithms.  
âœ… **Types:**  
   - **Wired Router** â€“ Uses Ethernet cables.  
   - **Wireless Router** â€“ Provides Wi-Fi connectivity.  
âœ… **Example:** The device that connects home networks to the internet.  
âœ… **Exam Tip:** A **router is essential for internet connectivity** and is different from a switch (which works within a LAN).
