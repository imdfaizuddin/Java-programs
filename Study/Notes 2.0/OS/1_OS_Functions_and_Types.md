### **What is an Operating System (OS)?**  
An **Operating System (OS)** is system software that acts as an interface between computer hardware and users. It manages hardware resources and provides services for computer programs. The OS allows users to interact with the computer without needing to understand its underlying hardware.

### **Functions of an Operating System**  

1. **Process Management**  
   - Handles the execution of multiple processes  
   - Allocates CPU time to processes  
   - Manages process creation, scheduling, and termination  

2. **Memory Management**  
   - Allocates and deallocates memory to programs  
   - Ensures efficient use of RAM  
   - Prevents memory leaks and fragmentation  

3. **File System Management**  
   - Organizes and stores files on storage devices  
   - Controls file access and permissions  
   - Maintains file directories and structures  

4. **Device Management**  
   - Manages input and output (I/O) devices like keyboards, printers, and disk drives  
   - Uses device drivers to communicate with hardware  
   - Ensures smooth operation of peripherals  

5. **Security & Access Control**  
   - Provides authentication (login, passwords, biometrics)  
   - Protects data from unauthorized access  
   - Implements firewalls and encryption  

6. **User Interface (UI) Management**  
   - Provides a graphical user interface (GUI) or command-line interface (CLI)  
   - Enables user interaction with applications and system settings  

7. **Networking**  
   - Manages network connections and communication between devices  
   - Supports internet and data sharing  

8. **Error Handling**  
   - Detects and handles system errors  
   - Logs errors for troubleshooting

### **Types of Operating Systems**  

1. **Batch Operating System**  
   - Executes jobs in batches without user interaction  
   - Example: IBM OS/360  

2. **Time-Sharing (Multitasking) OS**  
   - Allows multiple users to share system resources simultaneously  
   - Example: UNIX, Windows  

3. **Distributed OS**  
   - Runs on multiple machines connected via a network  
   - Example: Googleâ€™s Chrome OS, Windows Server  

4. **Real-Time OS (RTOS)**  
   - Provides quick response time for time-sensitive tasks  
   - Used in robotics, medical systems, and industrial control  
   - Example: VxWorks, QNX  

5. **Network Operating System (NOS)**  
   - Manages network resources and allows shared access  
   - Example: Windows Server, Linux Server  

6. **Mobile OS**  
   - Designed for smartphones and tablets  
   - Example: Android, iOS  

7. **Embedded OS**  
   - Used in dedicated systems like ATMs, smart appliances, and cars  
   - Example: FreeRTOS, Windows Embedded
