### **What is an Operating System (OS)?**  
An **Operating System (OS)** is system software that acts as an interface between computer hardware and users. It manages hardware resources and provides services for computer programs. The OS allows users to interact with the computer without needing to understand its underlying hardware.

   - Used in robotics, medical systems, and industrial control  
   - Example: VxWorks, QNX  

5. **Network Operating System (NOS)**  
   - Manages network resources and allows shared access  
   - Example: Windows Server, Linux Server  

6. **Mobile OS**  
   - Designed for smartphones and tablets  
   - Example: Android, iOS  

7. **Embedded OS**  
   - Used in dedicated systems like ATMs, smart appliances, and cars  
   - Example: FreeRTOS, Windows Embedded

### **Layers of an Operating System (OS)**  

An **Operating System (OS)** is structured in multiple layers, each responsible for different tasks. This layered architecture improves **modularity, security, and system management** by separating functionalities into distinct levels.  

---

## **Layers of an Operating System**  

The OS is typically divided into **six main layers**, from hardware interaction to user-level applications:

### **1. Hardware Layer**  
🔹 **Lowest layer**, directly interacting with physical components (CPU, memory, storage, input/output devices).  
🔹 Provides raw computational power, storage, and connectivity.  
🔹 The OS must control and manage hardware resources efficiently.  

📌 **Examples:** Processors, RAM, Hard Drive, Network Card, Peripheral Devices (Keyboard, Mouse, Printer).  

---

### **2. Kernel Layer**  
🔹 The **core** of the OS, managing system resources and hardware interaction.  
🔹 Runs in **privileged mode (kernel mode)** and controls all other layers.  
🔹 Responsible for **process scheduling, memory management, file system handling, and security**.  

📌 **Key Functions:**  
✅ **Process Management** – Handles running applications.  
✅ **Memory Management** – Allocates and deallocates memory.  
✅ **Device Management** – Communicates with hardware via drivers.  
✅ **Security & Access Control** – Manages permissions.  

📌 **Example:** Linux Kernel, Windows NT Kernel, XNU Kernel (macOS).  

---

### **3. Shell (Command & User Interface) Layer**  
🔹 Provides an **interface between the user and the OS**.  
🔹 Allows users to execute commands and manage files.  
🔹 Can be **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** or **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**.  

📌 **Types of Shells:**  
- **CLI (Command-Line Interface):** Text-based commands (e.g., Bash, PowerShell).  
- **GUI (Graphical User Interface):** Uses windows, icons, and buttons (e.g., Windows Explorer, macOS Finder).  

📌 **Examples:** Bash, Windows Command Prompt, GNOME Desktop (Linux).  

---

### **4. System Utility Layer (System Programs)**  
🔹 Provides essential utilities and system management tools.  
🔹 Includes programs for file management, monitoring processes, and system maintenance.  

📌 **Examples:**  
- **File Management Tools** – Windows File Explorer, Linux `ls` command.  
- **System Monitoring Tools** – Task Manager (Windows), `top` command (Linux).  
- **Networking Utilities** – Ping, FTP, SSH.  

---

### **5. Application Layer**  
🔹 The topmost layer, where **user applications** and software run.  
🔹 Includes all programs used for computing tasks (word processors, web browsers, games, etc.).  
🔹 Uses system calls to request OS services.  

📌 **Examples:**  
- **Web Browsers** – Chrome, Firefox, Edge.  
- **Office Applications** – Microsoft Word, Google Docs.  
- **Media Players** – VLC, Windows Media Player.  

---

### **6. User Layer**  
🔹 The **end-user interaction level**, where users interact with the system.  
🔹 Users interact with applications, which in turn use system utilities and the kernel to perform tasks.  

📌 **Examples:**  
- Users running software applications.  
- Interacting with the file system via GUI or CLI.
