# **Process in Operating System**  

## **🔹 What is a Process?**  
A **process** is a **program in execution**. When a program runs, it becomes a process and is managed by the operating system (OS). The OS allocates resources like **CPU time, memory, and I/O devices** to execute the process.  

📌 **Example:**  
- A **browser (Chrome, Firefox)** running on your system is a process.  
- A **media player** playing a song is a process.  
- A **compiler (GCC, Java)** translating code is a process.

## **🔹 Process vs. Program**
| **Aspect** | **Program** | **Process** |
|-----------|------------|------------|
| **Definition** | A static set of instructions (code). | A running instance of a program. |
| **State** | Stored on disk (not executing). | Active in memory (executing). |
| **Lifespan** | Exists permanently (until deleted). | Exists temporarily (until execution ends). |
| **Example** | A Microsoft Word file (`winword.exe`). | An open Word document being edited. |

📌 **Analogy:** A **recipe (program)** is an instruction set, while a **chef cooking (process)** is the execution of that recipe.

# **Process States in an Operating System**  

A **process** in an OS goes through different **states** as it executes. These states help the OS manage CPU time, memory, and other resources efficiently.  

---

## **🔹 Process States in Detail**  
A process typically transitions through **five main states**:  

1️⃣ **New**  
2️⃣ **Ready**  
3️⃣ **Running**  
4️⃣ **Waiting (Blocked)**  
5️⃣ **Terminated (Exit)**  

📌 **Process State Diagram:**  
```
            [ New ]  
               ↓   
            [ Ready ] ←───────┐  
               ↓              │  
            [ Running ] → [ Waiting ]  
               ↓              │  
            [ Terminated ] ←──┘  
```

## **🔹 Explanation of Each Process State**

### **1. New State**
- The process is **created** but has not started execution yet.  
- The OS **allocates** necessary resources like memory, files, and I/O.  
- The process waits to enter the **ready queue**.  

📌 **Example:**  
- A user clicks on a browser icon, and the OS starts preparing resources for execution.  

---

### **2. Ready State**
- The process is **waiting for CPU time**.  
- It is in the **ready queue**, managed by the CPU scheduler.  
- The process is **fully loaded into RAM** and is waiting to execute.  

📌 **Example:**  
- Multiple apps (browser, media player, text editor) are open, waiting for the CPU to execute them one by one.  

📌 **Transition:**  
- If the **CPU scheduler** picks the process, it moves to the **Running** state.  

---

### **3. Running State**
- The **CPU is actively executing** the process instructions.  
- Only **one** process can be in the running state per CPU core at a time.  

📌 **Example:**  
- When you type in a text editor, the CPU actively processes your keystrokes.  

📌 **Transition:**  
- If the process **completes execution**, it moves to the **Terminated** state.  
- If a **higher-priority process arrives**, it moves back to **Ready**.  
- If it needs **I/O**, it moves to the **Waiting** state.  

---

### **4. Waiting (Blocked) State**
- The process **pauses execution** and waits for an **I/O event** (keyboard, disk, network).  
- The CPU moves to another task while the process waits.  

📌 **Example:**  
- A process waits for **user input** (e.g., waiting for a file to load).  
- A process waits for a **network response** (e.g., downloading a file).  

📌 **Transition:**  
- Once the I/O request is complete, the process moves back to **Ready**.  

---

### **5. Terminated (Exit) State**
- The process **has finished execution** or was **forcefully stopped**.  
- The OS **deallocates** its memory and resources.  

📌 **Example:**  
- Closing a browser tab ends the process.  
- A program crashes, and the OS terminates it.  

📌 **Transition:**  
- The process is **removed** from the system.  

---

## **🔹 Additional Process States (Advanced OS Concepts)**  
Some operating systems introduce additional states:

### **6. Suspended (Ready)**
- The process is ready but is **moved to disk (swap memory)** due to low RAM.  
- The OS **temporarily pauses** it to free memory.  

📌 **Example:**  
- A minimized app that is not being used for a long time.  

### **7. Suspended (Blocked)**
- The process is waiting for **I/O but is also swapped to disk**.  
- Used in virtual memory systems to manage **inactive processes**.  

---

## **🔹 Process State Transitions (Summary)**  

| **State Transition** | **Reason** |
|---------------------|-----------|
| **New → Ready** | Process is created. |
| **Ready → Running** | CPU scheduler picks the process. |
| **Running → Waiting** | Process requests I/O. |
| **Running → Ready** | Higher-priority process arrives. |
| **Waiting → Ready** | I/O is completed. |
| **Running → Terminated** | Process completes execution or crashes. |

---

## **🔹 Conclusion**
- A **process changes states** during execution.  
- The **OS manages state transitions** to ensure efficient CPU utilization.  
- **Ready, Running, and Waiting** are the most common states.  
- **Suspended states** exist in advanced OS architectures.  

---

## **🔹 Process Control Block (PCB)**
The **Process Control Block (PCB)** is a **data structure** used by the OS to store **process information**. It helps manage and track the process.

### **Contents of PCB**
📌 **Process Identification** – Process ID (PID).  
📌 **Process State** – Ready, Running, Waiting, etc.  
📌 **CPU Registers** – Stores CPU context (PC, SP, etc.).  
📌 **Memory Management Info** – Stores memory usage details.  
📌 **I/O Status** – Tracks file and device usage.  
📌 **Priority** – Scheduling priority level.  

---

## **🔹 Types of Processes**
### **1. Foreground Process (User Process)**
- Interacts with the user directly.  
- Requires user input (e.g., text editors, browsers).  

### **2. Background Process (Daemon Process)**
- Runs in the background without user interaction.  
- Examples: Antivirus, System updates, Logging services.  

### **3. System Process**
- Essential OS processes running in the background.  
- Examples: Windows Services, Linux Daemons (`init`, `systemd`).  

---

## **🔹 Process Scheduling**
The OS schedules processes for execution using different algorithms like:  
✅ **FCFS (First Come, First Serve)**  
✅ **SJF (Shortest Job First)**  
✅ **Round Robin (RR)**  
✅ **Priority Scheduling**  

---

## **🔹 Conclusion**
- A **process is a running program** that needs CPU, memory, and I/O.  
- It goes through **different states** (New, Ready, Running, Waiting, Terminated).  
- The **PCB** stores process details.  
- The **OS schedules processes** to ensure efficient execution.

# **Process Scheduling & Types of Queues in OS**  

## **🔹 What is Process Scheduling?**  
Process Scheduling is the mechanism by which the operating system **decides which process gets CPU time** and in what order. The goal is to **maximize CPU utilization, reduce waiting time, and ensure fair execution of all processes**.  

📌 **Why is Process Scheduling Needed?**  
✅ The CPU can execute **only one process at a time per core**.  
✅ Multiple processes compete for the CPU.  
✅ The OS **switches between processes** efficiently.  
✅ Ensures **fairness** and **minimizes response time**.  

Maximize CPU utilization
Provide Fare allocation of CPU
Maximum throughput
Minimize turnaround time
Minimize waiting time
Minimize response time

## **🔹 Types of Process Scheduling**  

1️⃣ **Long-Term Scheduling** (Job Scheduling)  
2️⃣ **Short-Term Scheduling** (CPU Scheduling)  
3️⃣ **Medium-Term Scheduling** (Swapping)  

---

### **1. Long-Term Scheduler (Job Scheduler)**
- **Decides which processes enter the system** for execution.  
- Controls the **degree of multiprogramming** (number of processes in memory).  
- **Runs infrequently** (slow execution).  

📌 **Example:**  
- When a user runs multiple applications, the OS decides how many should be loaded into memory for execution.  

📌 **Key Point:** More processes in memory = More CPU utilization, but too many can lead to slow performance (thrashing).  

---

### **2. Short-Term Scheduler (CPU Scheduler)**
- **Decides which process gets CPU next**.  
- Runs **very frequently** (milliseconds).  
- Uses **scheduling algorithms** (FCFS, Round Robin, etc.).  

📌 **Example:**  
- If a text editor and a browser are running, the OS rapidly switches between them to give the illusion that both are running simultaneously.  

📌 **Key Point:** Short-term scheduler has the most impact on system performance.  

---

### **3. Medium-Term Scheduler (Swapper)**
- **Removes (swaps out) less important processes from memory** to free up space.  
- When needed, it **swaps them back in**.  
- Helps in **memory management**.  

📌 **Example:**  
- If you minimize a game for a long time, the OS may move it to disk (swap space) and bring it back when reopened.  

📌 **Key Point:** Used in systems with **virtual memory**.  

---

## **🔹 Types of Queues in Process Scheduling**  

1️⃣ **Job Queue**  
2️⃣ **Ready Queue**  
3️⃣ **Waiting Queue**  

---

### **1. Job Queue (New Process Queue)**
- Contains all **newly created processes** waiting to enter the system.  
- Managed by the **Long-Term Scheduler**.  

📌 **Example:**  
- A user opens five applications, but the OS only allows three into RAM while keeping the rest in the job queue.  

---

### **2. Ready Queue**
- Contains **all processes that are ready to run** but waiting for CPU time.  
- Managed by the **Short-Term Scheduler**.  
- Uses different **scheduling algorithms** to pick the next process.  

📌 **Example:**  
- If five applications are running, they wait in the **ready queue** for the CPU to execute them one by one.  

---

### **3. Waiting Queue (I/O Queue)**
- Contains **processes waiting for I/O operations** (disk, printer, network).  
- A process moves from **Running → Waiting Queue** if it requests I/O.  
- When the I/O completes, the process **moves back to the Ready Queue**.  

📌 **Example:**  
- A document waiting to be printed is in the waiting queue.  

---

## **🔹 Process Scheduling Example**  

```
User starts 4 applications → Placed in Job Queue  
Some are loaded into RAM → Placed in Ready Queue  
CPU executes one process → Moves to Running  
Process requests I/O → Moves to Waiting Queue  
I/O completes → Moves back to Ready Queue  
Process finishes → Moves to Terminated Queue  
```

---

## **🔹 Conclusion**
- **Process Scheduling ensures fair CPU allocation**.  
- The OS maintains **different queues** to manage processes efficiently.  
- The **Long-Term, Short-Term, and Medium-Term Schedulers** work together for smooth execution.
