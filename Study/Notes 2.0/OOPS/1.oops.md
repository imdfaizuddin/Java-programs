### OOPS 1 , Sept 21 | 70 pages pdf

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm centered around the concept of "objects," which can contain data (attributes or properties) and code (methods or functions). OOP focuses on organizing software design around data (objects) rather than functions and logic.

### Key Concepts of OOP:
1. **Objects**: Instances of classes that encapsulate data and behavior.
   - Example: A `Car` object might have attributes like `color`, `model`, and methods like `start()`, `stop()`.

2. **Classes**: Blueprints or templates for creating objects. A class defines the structure (attributes and methods) that its objects will have.
   - Example: A `Car` class defines the properties and behaviors common to all cars.

3. **Encapsulation**: Bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit (class). It also restricts direct access to some of an object's components, which is a way of preventing unintended interference.
   - Example: Hiding internal details of how a `Car` starts or stops.

4. **Inheritance**: A mechanism where a new class (child or subclass) derives properties and behaviors from an existing class (parent or superclass). This promotes code reusability.
   - Example: A `ElectricCar` class can inherit from the `Car` class and add specific features like `batteryCapacity`.

5. **Polymorphism**: The ability of objects to take on multiple forms. It allows methods to behave differently based on the object that calls them.
   - Example: A `Vehicle` class might have a `move()` method, and both `Car` and `Bike` classes can override this method to provide their own implementation.

6. **Abstraction**: Simplifying complex systems by modeling classes appropriate to the problem domain and hiding unnecessary details.
   - Example: A `Driver` doesnâ€™t need to know how the engine works to drive a car.

### Benefits of OOP:
- **Modularity**: Code is organized into reusable, self-contained objects.
- **Reusability**: Inheritance allows for code reuse, reducing redundancy.
- **Scalability**: Easier to manage and extend large codebases.
- **Maintainability**: Encapsulation and abstraction make code easier to understand and modify.

### Example in Python:
```python
# Class definition
class Car:
    def __init__(self, color, model):
        self.color = color
        self.model = model

    def start(self):
        print(f"{self.color} {self.model} is starting.")

    def stop(self):
        print(f"{self.color} {self.model} is stopping.")

# Object creation
my_car = Car("Red", "Tesla Model S")
my_car.start()  # Output: Red Tesla Model S is starting.
my_car.stop()   # Output: Red Tesla Model S is stopping.
```

### Common OOP Languages:
- Java
- C++
- Python
- C#
- Ruby
- JavaScript (with prototypes)

OOP is widely used in software development because it helps in creating flexible, modular, and maintainable code.

### Types of Inheritance

Inheritance is a key concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows a class (called a **child class** or **subclass**) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (called a **parent class** or **superclass**). Inheritance promotes **code reusability** and helps in creating a hierarchical relationship between classes.

There are **several types of inheritance**, depending on how classes inherit from one another:

---

### 1. **Single Inheritance**
   - A child class inherits from **only one parent class**.
   - This is the simplest and most common type of inheritance.
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     class Animal:
         def speak(self):
             print("Animal speaks")

     class Dog(Animal):  # Dog inherits from Animal
         def bark(self):
             print("Dog barks")

     dog = Dog()
     dog.speak()  # Inherited from Animal
     dog.bark()   # Defined in Dog
     ```

---

### 2. **Multiple Inheritance**
   - A child class inherits from **more than one parent class**.
   - This allows the child class to combine features from multiple classes.
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     class Father:
         def height(self):
             print("Tall")

     class Mother:
         def color(self):
             print("Fair")

     class Child(Father, Mother):  # Child inherits from both Father and Mother
         def skills(self):
             print("Programming")

     child = Child()
     child.height()  # Inherited from Father
     child.color()   # Inherited from Mother
     child.skills()  # Defined in Child
     ```

---

### 3. **Multilevel Inheritance**
   - A child class inherits from a parent class, which in turn inherits from another parent class.
   - This creates a **chain of inheritance**.
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     class Grandfather:
         def wealth(self):
             print("Rich")

     class Father(Grandfather):  # Father inherits from Grandfather
         def business(self):
             print("Family business")

     class Child(Father):  # Child inherits from Father
         def education(self):
             print("Engineering")

     child = Child()
     child.wealth()    # Inherited from Grandfather
     child.business()  # Inherited from Father
     child.education() # Defined in Child
     ```

---

### 4. **Hierarchical Inheritance**
   - **Multiple child classes** inherit from **a single parent class**.
   - This creates a hierarchy of classes.
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     class Animal:
         def eat(self):
             print("Eating")

     class Dog(Animal):  # Dog inherits from Animal
         def bark(self):
             print("Barking")

     class Cat(Animal):  # Cat also inherits from Animal
         def meow(self):
             print("Meowing")

     dog = Dog()
     cat = Cat()
     dog.eat()  # Inherited from Animal
     cat.eat()  # Inherited from Animal
     ```

---

### 5. **Hybrid Inheritance**
   - A combination of **multiple types of inheritance** (e.g., single, multiple, multilevel, or hierarchical).
   - This can create complex relationships between classes.
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     class A:
         def methodA(self):
             print("Method A")

     class B(A):  # Single inheritance
         def methodB(self):
             print("Method B")

     class C(A):  # Hierarchical inheritance
         def methodC(self):
             print("Method C")

     class D(B, C):  # Multiple inheritance
         def methodD(self):
             print("Method D")

     obj = D()
     obj.methodA()  # Inherited from A
     obj.methodB()  # Inherited from B
     obj.methodC()  # Inherited from C
     obj.methodD()  # Defined in D
     ```

---

### 6. **Cyclic Inheritance** (Not Supported in Most Languages)
   - When two or more classes inherit from each other in a cyclic manner.
   - This is **not allowed** in most programming languages because it creates a logical loop and is impractical.
   - **Example** (Invalid in Python):
     ```python
     class A(B):  # A inherits from B
         pass

     class B(A):  # B inherits from A
         pass
     ```

---

### Summary Table:

| Type of Inheritance       | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Single**                | One child class inherits from one parent class.                             |
| **Multiple**              | One child class inherits from multiple parent classes.                      |
| **Multilevel**            | A child class inherits from a parent, which itself inherits from another.   |
| **Hierarchical**          | Multiple child classes inherit from a single parent class.                  |
| **Hybrid**                | A combination of two or more types of inheritance.                         |
| **Cyclic**                | Two or more classes inherit from each other (not supported in most cases). |

### Notes:
- **Diamond Problem**: In multiple inheritance, if two parent classes have the same method, it can create ambiguity. Most languages (like Python) resolve this using a **Method Resolution Order (MRO)**.
- Not all programming languages support all types of inheritance. For example, Java does not support multiple inheritance for classes (but supports it for interfaces).

Inheritance is a powerful tool, but it should be used carefully to avoid overly complex and tightly coupled code.
