Problem statement

Given an array 'arr' of size 'n'.


Return an array with all the elements placed in reverse order.


Note:

You donâ€™t need to print anything. Just implement the given function.

Example:

Input: n = 6, arr = [5, 7, 8, 1, 6, 3]

Output: [3, 6, 1, 8, 7, 5]

Explanation: After reversing the array, it looks like this [3, 6, 1, 8, 7, 5].

Detailed explanation ( Input/output format, Notes, Images )
Sample Input 1:

8
3 1 1 7 4 2 6 11

Sample Output 1:

11 6 2 4 7 1 1 3    

Explanation Of Sample Input 1 :

After reversing the array, it looks like this [11, 6, 2, 4, 7, 1, 1, 3].

Sample Input 2:

4
8 1 3 2

Sample Output 2:

2 3 1 8

Explanation Of Sample Input 2 :

After reversing the array, it looks like this [2, 3, 1, 8].

Expected time complexity

The expected time complexity is O(n).

Constraints:

1 <= 'n' <= 10^6
-10^9 <= 'arr[i]' <=10^9
