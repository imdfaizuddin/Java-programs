### Input field value
<input type="text" class="fullWidth rightAlign" id="maintariffcost_0" value="" wfd-id="id15">
prompt - where is maintariffcost_ input field's value coming from

To determine where the value of the `maintariffcost_` input field is coming from, you can follow these steps:

1. **Inspect the HTML**: Check the HTML structure of your page. Look for the `maintariffcost_` input fields. They might be defined with an `id` or `name` attribute that looks like `maintariffcost_k`, where `k` is a variable index.

2. **Search for JavaScript Assignments**: In your JavaScript code, look for any functions or scripts that assign values to these input fields. You might find something like:

   ```javascript
   document.getElementById("maintariffcost_" + k).value = someValue;
   ```

   This would indicate that the value is set programmatically.

3. **Check for Data Bindings**: If you’re using a framework (like React, Vue, Angular, etc.), the value might be coming from a state or data property. Look for relevant data-binding syntax.

4. **Look for AJAX Calls**: If your application fetches data from a server, check if there's an AJAX call that retrieves tariff values. The response might populate these fields.

5. **Event Listeners**: If the value changes based on user interaction, inspect event listeners (like `input`, `change`, etc.) that might update the value when a user interacts with other elements.

6. **Console Logging**: If you’re unsure, you can add temporary `console.log` statements to see when and where values are being assigned or updated.

### Example of Searching in Code

- Look for a line that resembles:

  ```javascript
  var tariffValue = fetchTariffValue(); // Hypothetical function
  document.getElementById("maintariffcost_" + k).value = tariffValue;
  ```

### Summary

By inspecting the HTML and reviewing the JavaScript logic, you can trace where the values for the `maintariffcost_` input fields are coming from. If you find specific code snippets or behavior that you need help with, feel free to share!
