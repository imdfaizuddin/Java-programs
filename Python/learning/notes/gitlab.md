To undo the last commit in a GitLab repository, you have several options depending on whether you want to keep or discard the changes and whether or not the commit has been pushed to a remote repository. Here’s how you can handle each case:

### 1. **Undo Last Commit (Local Only)**

If you haven't pushed the commit yet and want to undo it locally:

- **Keep Changes (Unstage the Commit but Keep Changes in the Working Directory):**
  ```bash
  git reset --soft HEAD~1
  ```
  This will move the HEAD pointer back by one commit and keep your changes in the working directory so you can edit or re-commit them.

- **Discard Changes (Remove the Commit and Changes):**
  ```bash
  git reset --hard HEAD~1
  ```
  This command will remove the commit and discard any changes in the working directory. Be cautious, as this cannot be undone.

### 2. **Undo Last Commit (After Pushing to GitLab)**

If you have already pushed the commit to GitLab and want to undo it:

- **Revert the Commit:**
  Use `git revert` to create a new commit that undoes the changes made by the last commit. This is a safe way to undo changes without rewriting history.
  ```bash
  git revert HEAD
  ```
  After running this command, you’ll need to push the new commit to GitLab:
  ```bash
  git push origin <branch>
  ```

- **Force Push (Rewrite History):**
  If you need to completely remove the commit from the history (e.g., for sensitive data), you can use `git reset` and then force push. This can be disruptive if others are working on the same branch.
  
  - First, undo the last commit locally:
    ```bash
    git reset --hard HEAD~1
    ```
  - Then, force push the changes:
    ```bash
    git push origin <branch> --force
    ```

  **Important:** Force pushing should be used with caution and ideally avoided on shared branches. Ensure that other collaborators are aware of the changes to prevent conflicts.

### 3. **Using GitLab’s Web UI**

- **Revert a Commit:**
  If you want to revert a commit through GitLab’s interface, navigate to the repository on GitLab, find the commit you want to undo, and use the "Revert" button. This will create a new commit that undoes the changes made by the original commit.

### Summary

- **Local Undo (No Push):** Use `git reset --soft` or `git reset --hard` based on whether you want to keep or discard changes.
- **Undo After Push:** Use `git revert` to safely undo changes or `git reset --hard` with a force push if you need to rewrite history.
- **GitLab UI:** Revert commits directly on the GitLab interface if you prefer a graphical method.

### Step 2

When you run `git revert HEAD`, Git opens your default text editor to allow you to provide a commit message for the revert commit. This step is where you can confirm or modify the commit message for the revert operation. Here's a step-by-step guide to handle this:

### Steps to Confirm or Modify the Revert Commit Message

1. **Run the Revert Command:**
   ```bash
   git revert HEAD
   ```
   This will open the default text editor (e.g., Vim, Nano, or others) with a pre-filled commit message.

2. **Edit the Commit Message (Optional):**
   - **In Vim:**
     - You will see something like:
       ```
       Revert "Commit message of the original commit"

       This reverts commit <commit-hash>.
       ```
     - To modify the commit message, press `i` to enter insert mode, make your changes, then press `Esc` to exit insert mode.
     - Save and exit by typing `:wq` and pressing `Enter`.
   
   - **In Nano:**
     - You will see a similar pre-filled message.
     - Modify the message if needed, then save by pressing `Ctrl + O`, and exit by pressing `Ctrl + X`.

   - **In Other Editors:**
     - The process will be similar: edit the message if desired, save the file, and exit the editor.

3. **Confirm the Commit:**
   - After saving and closing the editor, Git will create a new commit that reverts the changes made by the original commit.

4. **Push the Revert Commit (if needed):**
   ```bash
   git push origin <branch>
   ```
   Replace `<branch>` with the name of your branch.

### Summary

- **Git Revert Command:** Creates a new commit that undoes the changes made by the previous commit.
- **Commit Message Editing:** The text editor lets you provide or modify a commit message for the revert commit.
- **Push Changes:** If you’re working with a remote repository, don’t forget to push your changes after reverting.

If you encounter any issues with the text editor or need further assistance, let me know!

### Step 3

The error message you're seeing indicates that you have uncommitted changes in your working directory that conflict with the revert operation. Git won't let you revert a commit if there are uncommitted changes that might be overwritten. Here’s how to resolve this issue:

### Steps to Resolve the Issue

1. **Review Uncommitted Changes:**
   First, check what changes are in your working directory:
   ```bash
   git status
   ```

2. **Option 1: Commit Your Changes**
   If you want to keep your changes, you can commit them first:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Save changes before reverting"
   ```
   After committing your changes, you can retry the revert operation:
   ```bash
   git revert HEAD
   ```

3. **Option 2: Stash Your Changes**
   If you don’t want to commit your current changes but want to temporarily set them aside, you can stash them:
   ```bash
   git stash
   ```
   This saves your changes and cleans your working directory. You can then perform the revert:
   ```bash
   git revert HEAD
   ```
   After the revert, you can reapply your stashed changes:
   ```bash
   git stash pop
   ```

4. **Option 3: Discard Uncommitted Changes**
   If you don’t need your uncommitted changes and you’re okay with losing them, you can discard them:
   ```bash
   git reset --hard
   ```
   This command will remove all uncommitted changes. Be very careful with this command, as it will discard all changes in your working directory and staging area.

5. **Option 4: Review Conflicts and Resolve Manually**
   If you suspect that the changes might be relevant or you need to resolve conflicts manually:
   - **Temporarily Stash Changes:**
     ```bash
     git stash
     ```
   - **Perform the Revert:**
     ```bash
     git revert HEAD
     ```
   - **Apply Your Stashed Changes:**
     ```bash
     git stash pop
     ```
   - **Resolve Any Merge Conflicts:**
     If conflicts arise after applying the stash, resolve them manually and commit the resolved changes.

### Summary

- **Commit Changes:** Save your work if you want to keep it.
- **Stash Changes:** Temporarily set aside your changes to perform the revert.
- **Discard Changes:** Remove uncommitted changes if they’re not needed.
- **Resolve Manually:** Handle conflicts if needed.

Choose the option that best fits your needs based on whether you want to keep, stash, or discard your changes. If you have any specific questions or run into issues, let me know!
